## Somebody once told me...

> the world is gonna roll me

- I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed

She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an '*L*' on her forehead.
Well the years start coming and they **don't stop** coming.

```java
    fedToTheRules = true;
    if(fedToTheRules) {
        hitTheGroundRunning();
    }
```
